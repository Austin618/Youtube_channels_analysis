### Motivation
There are more than 1 billion unique users visit YouTube each month and there are 37 million channels on YouTube. With so many channels coming up on Youtube, how to create high quality titles and descriptions for the youtube channel is important for all the youtubers. This website that could help people, especially YouTubers, to analyze how to create a popular youtube channel. The user would need to provide a channelId to the website and the website would all the channel information including channel title, channel description, playlists, videos, etc. The most important part is that it would help the user to find what are the keywords they can put into the video title and description to catch peopleâ€™s eyes. The keywords are generated based on the previously published popular videos on this channel.
